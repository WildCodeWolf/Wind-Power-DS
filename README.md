# Wind-Power-DS

This is a small Data Analysis and Data Science exercise on a wind power related
dataset found on [kaggle](kaggle.com).

You can find information on the data in [this](data/README.md) README within
the `data` directory.

The repo consists of several notebooks, covering different aspects of the
analysis.  You can read though them as you like, but if you want to follow
the intended reading order, you should start with the
[EDA notebook](./eda.ipynb) first, and then follow the links in the notebooks.
