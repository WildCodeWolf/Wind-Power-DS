# Data

The original data can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mubashirrahim/wind-power-generation-data-forecasting)
where it has been published under the [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licence.

The dataset consists of four `.csv` files, each representing a power plant
location, and a [readme.txt](readme.txt) file explaining their structure.

You will not find those files in this repo; pushing them would be redundant.
With the exception of this README the `data/` directory has been included
in the `.gitignore` file.
If you want to run any of the notebooks on your machine, use the given link
to download and copy the files from their origin into the `data/` directory
on your local machine.
